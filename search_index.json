Bookdown was chosen as the medium for generating the report as part of my personal effort to support reproducible computational science. The lavaan package was used for all structural equation models. The bookdown report is hosted at https://saverymax.github.io/sem-political-trust/. The R/Rmd code for the report can be found here: https://github.com/saverymax/sem-political-trust. The plain R script to run all the code used in this report is available at https://github.com/saverymax/sem-political-trust/blob/main/Max_Savery_SEM_project_code.R To locally render the book, install bookdown and run install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) bookdown::render_book(&#39;index.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::pdf_book&#39;) That being said, given the time constraints of the semester and finishing my master’s thesis, the bookdown report isn’t perfect. But having a more-or-less well-documented and reproducible project is better than not having one at all. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction We introduce the topic of this report: We conduct structural equations modelling on European Social Survey data, in order to This report focuses on the relationship between individual’s trust in government, trust in others, and perceived political ability. We use European Social Survey (ESS) data in this work, with only responses from round 9 , as that had all the variables we wanted to include in this study. We split them into three categories, which will become our latent variables: Extent of trust in government or institutions, social trust (or general trust in people), and the extent to which people perceive it possible to participate in their country’s political system. In a mediation analysis described later, we will also consider the effect of political interest on trust in government. The variables used in the analysis are shown in Table and are taken from the ESS documentation . Before we can begin with CFA and SEM, We first discuss the correlation present in the data. From the correlation plot , it can be seen that there are high levels of correlation between the variables related to trust in government. This will likely affect our model specification later on, when using the modificaiton indices to choose which indicators to remove and which residual covariances to add. Interestingly, political interest (polintr) is highly negatively correlated with one’s reported ability to actively participate in politics (actrolga) and one’s confidence to do so (cptppola). This insight will be important when we formulate the mediation model. Figure 2.1: Correlation between variables related to government trust, social trust, and poltical ability. "],["modelling-trust-in-government.html", "3 Modelling trust in government", " 3 Modelling trust in government Here we investigate a CFA model for the latent factor representing trust in government, in order to determine the measurement component our SEM model. We start with CFA for only the exogenous variables describing trust in government, because if we are not able to model these with a latent factor, the research question underlying this report will be a moot point. We first fit a one-factor CFA model with variables Table shows the standardized solution for the one-factor model. Note that this report will only present standardized solutions, for ease of interpretation of the factor loadings; however, standardized solutions are not always helpful if it is necessary to understand linear relationships in terms of their original scale. Nonetheless, it can be seen that the standardized loadings are all greater than \\(0.6\\). In fact, all loadings for trust in government institutions are quite high, with only trust in the U.N. somewhat lower at \\(0.66\\). We then examine the modification indices in Table . Given the high value for the trstplt variable, we remove this variable, and add covariances and .

Table compares the two models. It can be seen that the modified model does in fact fit better, across all fit measures. At the onset of this work, it was not clear if the indicators for government trust could be represented with a latent factor. These results indicate that representing trust in government with a measurement model is indeed possible and produces reasonable factor scores for each indicator on the latent variable.
