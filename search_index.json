Bookdown was chosen as the medium for generating the report as part of my personal effort to support reproducible computational science. The lavaan package was used for all structural equation models. The bookdown report is hosted at https://saverymax.github.io/sem-political-trust/. The R/Rmd code can be found here: https://github.com/saverymax/sem-political-trust. An R script to run all the code used in this report is available at https://github.com/saverymax/sem-political-trust/blob/main/Max_Savery_SEM_project_code.R To locally render the book, run install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) bookdown::render_book(&#39;index.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::pdf_book&#39;) That being said, given the time constraints of the semester and finishing my master’s thesis, the bookdown formatting isn’t perfect. But having a more-or-less well-documented and reproducible project is better than not having one at all. I heavily relied on https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo for setting it up. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction This report focuses on the relationship between individual trust in government, trust in others, and perceived ability to participate in the political system of one’s country. We use the European Social Survey (ESS) data in this work, with only responses from round 9 . We split the variables into three categories, which will become our latent variables: Extent of trust in government or institutions, social trust (or general trust in people), and the extent to which people perceive it possible to participate in their country’s political system. In a mediation analysis described later, we will also consider the effect of political interest on poltical ability. The variables used in the analysis are shown in Table , with descriptions taken from the ESS documentation . Before we can begin with CFA and SEM, We first discuss the correlation present in the data. From the correlation plot in Figure , it can be seen that there are high levels of correlation between the variables related to trust in government. This will likely affect our model specification later on, when using the modification indices to choose which indicators to remove and which residual covariances to add. Interestingly, political interest (polintr) is highly negatively correlated with one’s reported ability to actively participate in politics (actrolga) and one’s confidence to do so (cptppola). This insight will be important when we formulate the mediation model. Figure 2.1: Correlation between variables related to government trust, social trust, and poltical ability. "],["modelling-trust-in-government.html", "3 Modelling trust in government", " 3 Modelling trust in government Here we investigate a CFA model for the latent factor representing trust in government, in order to determine the measurement component of our SEM model. We start with CFA for only the variables describing trust in government, because if we are not able to model these with a latent factor, the research question underlying this report will be a moot point. The 1-factor CFA model can be written as Table shows the standardized solution for the 1-factor model. Note that this report will only present standardized solutions, for ease of interpretation of the factor loadings, particularly the fact that the squared loadings are equal to the proportion of variance the latent factor explains in the indicator; however, standardized solutions are not always helpful if it is necessary to understand linear relationships in terms of their original scale. Nonetheless, it can be seen that the standardized loadings are all greater than \\(0.6\\). In fact, all loadings for trust in government institutions are quite high, with only trust in the U.N. somewhat lower at \\(0.66\\). Furthermore, all loadings are positive, indicating that as the score of the latent construct increases, so too do the exogenous variables.

Given the high values for correlations involving the trstplt variable, we remove this variable, and add the residual covariance . We refit this modified model, for which the standardized solution is shown in Table . Table compares the two models. It can be seen that the modified model does in fact fit better, across all fit measures. At the onset of this work, it was not clear if the indicators for government trust could be represented with a latent factor. These results indicate that representing trust in government with a measurement model is indeed possible and produces reasonable factor scores for each indicator on the latent variable. Additionally, we can see that the model allowing for the covariances appears to be well-fitting, considering the \\(\\chi^2\\), CFI, TFI, and RMSEA measures.

The fit of the 2-factor model is shown in Table . Right away, it appears that the 2-factor model is not correctly handling the correlation in the data, because the loadings for the indicators relating to social trust have relatively low loadings on the trust construct. As these are nested models , we can test the difference between them with a \\(\\chi^2\\) difference test, shown in Table . The models are significantly different, indicating that the 3-factor model significantly improves the fit.

It can be seen that the 3-factor model has a better goodness-of-fit. However, the fit is not completely satisfactory, as the TFI and CLI are low while the RMSEA is somewhat high. Therefore, we proceed to improve the 3-factor model. The modification indices for this model are shown in Table .

From this, we add the indicator trstep into the regression relationship with social trust and add the residual covariance . The cross-loading of trstep onto social trust is interesting because there certainly could be a directional relationship between the extent to which people trust in institutions such as the European Union and the extent to which they trust in others. We again refit the model, and show the estimates in Table . It can be seen that the cross-loading for trstep on the social trust latent factor is small and negative. We take this to mean that while there is an interesting relationship between trust in the European parliament and social trust, it is not correctly represented in the specification of the measurement model here, and potentially could be part of a structural relationship. The fit measures of the original 3-factor model and the two modified models are shown in Table . While both modified models provide a much better fit than the original, the second set of modifications appears to make only a marginal difference. Given the small negative loading of trstep on social trust, we proceed with the model with only the first set of modifications. This model will be used in our mediation analysis.

Specifically, we consider a mediation model to explore the influence of political interest on political ability. We include the indirect effect of political interest through government trust. We also consider the influence of social trust on government trust. find that there is a strong relationship between these two trust-related factors, potentially in contrast to previous work at the individual level. They state, “The figures suggest that generalized social trust, political confidence, and satisfaction with democracy are indeed tied together in a tight three-cornered syndrome” (p. 719). While not considering satisfaction with democracy here, we are interested on the relationship between trust and political activity and participation. We mediate social trust through government trust because, as described in , there is a positive relationship between trust in people and institutions. However, trust in individuals does not necessarily transfer directly to being more likely to engage in political activities. Therefore, mediation is suitable to model this relationship.

Table shows the parameter estimates. We can see that the indirect effect is significant. Therefore, government trust mediates between political interest and one’s described ability to participate in the political system. However, the direct path from political interest to perceived political ability is also significant, meaning that political interest interacts with perceived political ability through both of these pathways. The coefficient for political interest between government trust and political ability was negative in both cases, indicating that as political interest increases, trust in government and political ability decreases. Furthermore, the total effect for political interest on political ability was negative and significant. The reason for these negative relationships isn’t necessarily clear, though it was also observed in the correlation plot in Figure . While it may be the case that individuals who are more politically interested may be more likely to participate in politics, this doesn’t necessarily mean they will trust the political system or the government institutions more. In fact, higher political interest could indicate more awareness of political issues and thus more skepticism of the political system or processes, depending on the country. Given the negative correlation between political interest and both latent factors (government trust and poltical ability), the relationship merits more investigation. The indirect effect of social trust, , is also significant. This indicates that government trust mediates this effect. Additionally, the direct effect of social trust on political ability is insignificant. In this case, social trust only affects political ability through government trust. This is somewhat reasonable: While people who are more trusting in general may be more likely to trust institutions, there may not be any relationship between the tendency to trust people and the tendency to believe in the effectiveness of actions taken through the political system. However, people who trust institutions could be much more likely to believe that they can effect change through these institutions. Of course, this will be highly dependent on the country and political system of interest. Figure 5.1: Mediation model graph structure "],["discussion.html", "6 Discussion", " 6 Discussion We have conducted a SEM analysis on the relationship between social trust, trust in government, and perceived ability to participate in the political system of one’s country. We first fit a CFA model to determine the measurement components of the CFA model. Settling on a 3-factor model, with latent factors for government trust, social trust, and political ability, we then proceed to fit a SEM model to conduct a mediation analysis between political interest, government trust, and social trust. We find that there is mediation between (1) political interest and government trust, affecting political ability, and (2) mediation between social trust and government trust, affecting political ability. That is, the extent to which one is interested in politics will have a negative impact, directly and indirectly, on the extent to which it is believed that it is possible to participate in a given political system. Furthermore, social trust will have a positive, but indirect, impact. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
