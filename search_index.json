Bookdown was chosen as the medium for generating the report as part of my personal effort to support reproducible computational science. The lavaan package was used for all structural equation models. The bookdown report is hosted at https://saverymax.github.io/sem-political-trust/. The R/Rmd code for the report can be found here: https://github.com/saverymax/sem-political-trust. The plain R script to run all the code used in this report is available at https://github.com/saverymax/sem-political-trust/blob/main/Max_Savery_SEM_project_code.R To locally render the book, install bookdown and run install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) bookdown::render_book(&#39;index.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::pdf_book&#39;) That being said, given the time constraints of the semester and finishing my master’s thesis, the bookdown report isn’t perfect. But having a more-or-less well-documented and reproducible project is better than not having one at all. I heavily relied on https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo for setting it up. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction We introduce the topic of this report: We conduct structural equations modelling on European Social Survey data, in order to This report focuses on the relationship between individual’s trust in government, trust in others, and perceived political ability. We use European Social Survey (ESS) data in this work, with only responses from round 9 , as that had all the variables we wanted to include in this study. We split them into three categories, which will become our latent variables: Extent of trust in government or institutions, social trust (or general trust in people), and the extent to which people perceive it possible to participate in their country’s political system. In a mediation analysis described later, we will also consider the effect of political interest on trust in government. The variables used in the analysis are shown in Table and are taken from the ESS documentation . Before we can begin with CFA and SEM, We first discuss the correlation present in the data. From the correlation plot , it can be seen that there are high levels of correlation between the variables related to trust in government. This will likely affect our model specification later on, when using the modificaiton indices to choose which indicators to remove and which residual covariances to add. Interestingly, political interest (polintr) is highly negatively correlated with one’s reported ability to actively participate in politics (actrolga) and one’s confidence to do so (cptppola). This insight will be important when we formulate the mediation model. Figure 2.1: Correlation between variables related to government trust, social trust, and poltical ability. "],["modelling-trust-in-government.html", "3 Modelling trust in government", " 3 Modelling trust in government Here we investigate a CFA model for the latent factor representing trust in government, in order to determine the measurement component our our SEM model. We start with CFA for only the exogenous variables describing trust in government, because if we are not able to model these with a latent factor, the research question underlying this report will be a moot point. We first fit a 1-factor CFA model with variables Table shows the standardized solution for the 1-factor model. Note that this report will only present standardized solutions, for ease of interpretation of the factor loadings, particularly the fact that the squared loadings are equal to the proportion of variance the latent factor explains in the indicator; however, standardized solutions are not always helpful if it is necessary to understand linear relationships in terms of their original scale. Nonetheless, it can be seen that the standardized loadings are all greater than \\(0.6\\). In fact, all loadings for trust in government institutions are quite high, with only trust in the U.N. somewhat lower at \\(0.66\\). Furthermore, all loadings are positive, indicating that as the score of the latent construct increases, so too do the exogenous variables.

Given the high values for correlations involving the trstplt variable, we remove this variable, and add the residual covariance . We refit this modified model, for which the standardized solution is shown in Table . Table compares the two models. It can be seen that the modified model does in fact fit better, across all fit measures. At the onset of this work, it was not clear if the indicators for government trust could be represented with a latent factor. These results indicate that representing trust in government with a measurement model is indeed possible and produces reasonable factor scores for each indicator on the latent variable. Additionally, we can see that the model allowing for the covariances appears to be well-fitting, considering the \\(\\chi^2\\), CFI, TFI, and RMSEA measures.

The fit of the 2-factor model is shown in Table . Right away, it appears that the 2-factor model is not correctly handling the correlation in the data, because the loadings for the indicators relating to social trust have relatively low loadings on the trust construct. As these are nested models , we can test the difference between them with a \\(\\chi^2\\) difference test, shown in Table . The models are significantly different, indicating that the 3-factor model significantly improves the fit.

It can be seen that the 3-factor model has a better goodness-of-fit. However, the fit is not completely satisfactory, as the TFI and CLI are low while the RMSEA is somewhat high. Therefore, we proceed to improve the 3-factor model. The modification indices for this model are shown in Table . Following the bread crumbs left by the perturbations with the highest modification indices, we attempt to improve the fit by removing the variable trstplt.

From this, we add the indicator trstep into the regression relationship with social trust and add the residual covariance . The cross-loading of trstep onto social trust is interesting because there certainly could be a directional relationship between the extent to which people trust in institutions such as the European Union and the extent to which they trust in others. We again refit the model, and show the estimates in Table . It can be seen that the cross-loading for trstep on the social trust latent factor is small and negative. We take this to mean that while there is an interesting relationship between trust in the European parliament and social trust, it is not correctly represented in the specification of the measurement model here, and potentially could be part of a structural relationship. The fit measures of the original 3-factor model and the two modified models are shown in Table . While both modified models provide a much better fit than the original, the second set of modifications appears to make only a marginal difference. Given the small negative loading of trstep on social trust, we proceed with the model with only the first set of modifications. This model will be used in our mediation analysis.

Specifically, we consider a mediation model to explore the influence of political interest on political ability. We include the indirect effect of political interest through government trust. We also consider the influence of trust in people on government trust. what is the effect of political interest and trust in government on how people conceive of their ability to participate in politics?
